* Refactor and document MoveJointGroup
* Replace test_depend with build_depend
* Use existing msg types for traj points. Refs `#4 <https://github.com/pal-robotics/play_motion/issues/4>`_.

0.3.1 (2013-12-04)
------------------
* Populate velocity data

  * Velocities are populated only for motions that don't specify velocities for at least one waypoint.
  * Good compromise: Smoother than Fritsch-Butland, while still allowing to hold position in equal consecutive waypoints (one of the heuristics we wanted).
